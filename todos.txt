1 - Create a Warning Page that includes an account_id column and a cause column.
This page will be used to log warnings received from Instagram activities such as following or direct messaging.
Each warning will be recorded as a new row in the table, and the duration column will specify the number of hours remaining
until the ban is lifted.
At the start of the process, there should be a base class named ProcessStart (or a similar name).
This class will contain hooks like before_process_hook, which will assess the overall status of the account.
If the account is under suspension or facing a challenge, it will prevent entry into the events.
Then, iterate over the events, where each event is associated with a category that corresponds to a category in
the warning table. Before initiating each event, check for any related warnings in the event's category.
If the duration of the ban has elapsed, the event is allowed to proceed; otherwise,
display an appropriate message and prevent entry.

Additionally, implement a Warning Page within the dashboard to display these warnings.

This structure ensures that the warning system is organized and that each step of the process is clearly defined.
The use of hooks allows for pre-event checks, ensuring that actions are only taken when appropriate,
based on the account's status. The dashboard page provides a user-friendly interface to monitor and review warnings.
